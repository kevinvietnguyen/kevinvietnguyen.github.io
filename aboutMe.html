								<p>My name is Kevin Viet Nguyen and I graduated in the class of 2021 from San Jose State University with a B.S. in Computer Science.
									I grew up in the city of San Jose as a part of a family of four. Prior to attending San Jose State University, I attended Mount Pleasant High School
									and had the honor of graduating as one of the Valedictorians. In my free time, I typically like to spend my time enjoying myself, whether it be playing video games or completing work.
								</p>
								<p>Coding has always been an interest as mine as problem solving as always what I enjoyed most.
									And after spending the more recent years of my life developing my ability to code, it seems like I was not wrong. The satisfaction of completing a project or a huge milestone has been one of the best
									feelings I felt. While my time in the classroom may be finished, I still expect to code and maybe develop a few personal proejcts of my own. </p>
